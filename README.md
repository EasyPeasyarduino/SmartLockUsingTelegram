# SmartLockUsingTelegram
Create a smart doorbell system that integrates face recognition technology with a Telegram notification system. The project uses an Arduino, a camera module, and an LCD display. When a visitor is detected, the system captures their face, recognizes whether they are a known face and sends a notification to the homeowner on Telegram with a photo.
